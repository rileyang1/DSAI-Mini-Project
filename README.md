CZ1115 - Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence Mini Project

# Welcome to our mini project repository

## About

This is a Mini-Project for CZ1115 which focuses on movies from [IMDB 5000 Movie Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/carolzhangdc/imdb-5000-movie-dataset). 

In particular, our notebook details the following:
1. Data Processing (Handling Null Values and Removing Duplicates)
2. Feature Engineering
3. EDA for Response Variable, Gross
4. EDA for Numeric Features
5. EDA for Categorical Features
6. Dimensionality Reduction and Robust Scale Transformation
7. Baseline Models
8. Improvements to Baseline Models
9. Model Discussions and Conclusion

- @rileyang1 - EDA, Dimensionality Reduction, Robust Scaling, Gradient Boosting Model

## Problem Definition
Every year thousands of movies are filmed and produced but not all of them breakeven. An even lesser number of movies make it as a "box-office hit". In this project, we intend to create a machine learning model that predicts which movies generate more gross revenue based on information available on IMDB, an online database for movies 

## Models Used

1. Linear Regression
2. Decision Trees
3. Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting
